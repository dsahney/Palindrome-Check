This project is one that is based off a problem I worked on while enroled in a certificate course on Coursera by the University of Toronto, known as Learn to Program: Crafting Quality Code.

A palindrome is a sequence of letters, which are the same when read backwards or forwards.
For example, the string 'rtytr' is a palindrome, because whether it is read from the front or the back, they will be the same string. 
The string 'apple' is not a palindrome. 

In this repository, I have created functions that determine whether a string is an palindrome or not, using three algorithms that accomplish the same task in three different ways.

I have also created automated test cases using unit test.

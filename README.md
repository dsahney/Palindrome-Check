A palindrome is a sequence of letters, in which they act as a "mirror" for example, the string 'rtytr' is a palindrome the reason is because the first and last indices are 'r'
# second and second last indices are 't'
# etc. etc.

# the string 'apple' is not a palindrome.

# I will create a function that determines whether a string is a palindrome.
# I will design three algorithms
